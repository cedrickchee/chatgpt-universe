# ChatGPT Universe

This tiny place of the Web stores a growing collection of interesting things
about [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and GPT-3 from OpenAI.

I want an all-in-one place to keep things about ChatGPT. So, I hand-curated this
list with the help of others (acknowleged below).

The collections are not limited to only the best resources, tools, examples,
demos, hacks, apps, and usages of ChatGPT.

<!-- my personal brain dumps? -->

---

The following resources started off based on awesome-chatgpt lists[^1][^2] but with my
own modifications:

## General Resources

- [ChatGPT launch blog post](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)
- [ChatGPT official app](https://chat.openai.com)
- [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) - a pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT.
- [Official ChatGPT and Whisper APIs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) - Developers can now integrate ChatGPT models into their apps and products through the API.
    > Model: The ChatGPT model family we are releasing today, **`gpt-3.5-turbo`, is the same model used in the ChatGPT** product. It is **priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models**.
    >
    > API: Traditionally, GPT models consume unstructured text, which is represented to the model as a sequence of “tokens.” ChatGPT models instead consume a sequence of messages together with metadata.

    > In brief, it appears that Sydney has somewhat different machinery under the hood than ChatGPT, and the transcripts suggests **a personality that is about the same in terms of coherence, but a wild leap beyond in terms of charisma and colorfulness**. Depending on how you push Sydney, it/they appears capable of playing everything from a mean manipulative teenager to a paranoid psychotic, to a stubborn and peremptory conversational martinet.

This post discusses the concept of emergent deception and emergent optimization which are two strategies that can be used to achieve a goal. There's two principles for reasoning about future emergent capabilities: 1) capabilities that would lower training loss will likely emerge in the future. 2) as models get larger and are trained on more and better data, simple heuristics tend to get replaced by complex ones. Principle 1 means LLMs trained to predict words get lower loss if they can simulate planning abilities.

    > I think it's very likely that this model release will be a huge milestone.
    > The ability to **run LLaMA on a single A100 GPU** — which "most of us either have access to ... or know someone that can let us use one for a bit” — is a “huge leap.”
    
    To be exact, you can run LLaMA-65B in int8 precision (bnb) on a single A100 80GB GPU.
    
    > Turns out, that code sucks. I really don't want to be too harsh on them, since it's easy to underestimate just how important it is to get the default settings exactly right. But their defaults were all screwed up. They didn't use "Top K". They used Top P, which I never got good results from (either identical to top k or slightly worse). Their default temperature was 0.8, which was way too high. And worst of all, they didn't have a repetition penalty -- so by default, this thing would just yammer on and on about exactly the same thing.
    
    100% this! I learned my lesson too in my LLaMA fork. My sampler settings were not optimal. The yammering is obvious and I've seen it. But I don't know why I didn't fix the sampler repetition penalty earlier.

## Prompting (Prompt Programming[^5])*

According to Gwern:
> A new programming paradigm? You interact with it, expressing any task in terms of natural language descriptions, requests, and examples, tweaking the prompt until it "understands" & it meta-learns the new task. This is a rather different way of using a model, and it's better to think of it as a new kind of programming, **prompt programming**, where the prompt is now a coding language which programs GPT-3 to do new things.

"Prompting" as an engineering discipline is not here to stay. It's a temporary crutch on the way to natural language interfaces. ChatGPT solves a big portion of the prompting problem. Adding engineering to a term to amplify its perceived importance or difficulty might be unnecessary. We could probably call it "prompt testing/hacking" and not lose any of the meaning.

Apparently in 2023, prompt programming is not dead. [The hottest new programming language is English ~ Karpathy](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1617979122625712128.html) :))

Simon Willison published [_In defense of prompt engineering_](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/21/in-defense-of-prompt-engineering/) as a counter to the "prompt engineering will be made obsolete as AIs get better" argument that he keep seeing.

### Open Source ChatGPT

We want a ChatGPT alternative like Stable Diffusion.

Frustrated by all the gatekeeping around AI? Still waiting or cannot get access to LLaMA? <!-- LLaMA is for research only and has a restrictive license (not for commercial use). AI is fundamentally entrenched in gatekeeping. Still remember Kaggle winners keeping their model to themselves? Unpopular opinon: until engineers can read and understand the latest research papers, we won't be there. -->

**Goals**

- Open source effort towards OpenAI's ChatGPT.
- Reverse engineer and replicate ChatGPT models and training data.
- Truly open models. 100% non-profit. 100% free.

**Ultimate goal:** self-hosted version of ChatGPT.

**Lessons**

Takeaways from [EleutherAI one year retro (2021)](https://blog.eleuther.ai/year-one/):
- Access to enough compute/hardware/GPU alone won't help you succeed. You need:
  - a proper dataset (beyond the Pile and [c4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4))
  - research expertise
  - engineering capabilities
  - a lot of hard work
<!-- Long version: even if you throw money or free credits for Cloud compute it will not be enough.
We've seen this happen with EleutherAI who were not capable of reaching their initial target of "replicating" GPT-3 and 
could only deliver the GPT-NeoX 20B model despite all the free compute, etc.-->

#### Projects

- [FLAN-T5 XXL](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) aka. ChatGPT@Home is a public model that has undergone instruction finetuning. XXL is a 11B model. It is currently the most comparable model against ChatGPT (InstructGPT models are initialized from GPT-3.x series ([model card](https://github.com/openai/following-instructions-human-feedback/blob/main/model-card.md))). There are successful attempts deploying FLAN-T5 on GPU with 24 GB RAM with [bitsandbytes-Int8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxSo4lQgMDBdnd19VBEoaG-mMfQupQ3XvOrgmRAVtpU/edit) inference for Hugging Face models. You can run the model easily on a single machine, without performance degradation. This could be a game changer in enabling people outside of big tech companies being able to use these LLMs. Efforts are already underway to create a better FLAN-T5. The community (i.e., LAION) are working on FlanT5-Atlas architecture and a collection of prompted/instructions datasets.
  - [Fine-tuning GPT-J-6B in Colab: 8-bit weights with low-rank adaptors (LORA)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14839). ([Quantized EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b model with 8-bit weights](https://huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit))
    - How many GPU and how much VRAM is required to run the model? Around 175GB or ~8x 24GB consumer GPUs. Details: [A Gentle Introduction to 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for transformers at scale using Hugging Face Transformers, Accelerate and bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)
  - Why FLAN-T5? They are more aligned than other LLM because it's already been finetuned with instructions. Furthermore, the largest version, [11B can run on a single NVIDIA T4](https://www.philschmid.de/deploy-t5-11b).
  - Accelerating deep learning computing — efficient training, efficient inference (deployment), data/memory efficient models, and compression (efficient architectures).
    - Apply compression techniques like quantization from my [Awesome ML model compression](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-ml-model-compression#quantization) project.

- [Open-Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Chat-GPT) - Open-source ChatGPT replication by LAION, Yannic Kilcher et al. This project is meant to give everyone access to a great chat based large language model. ([Open Assistant Live Coding with Yannic Kilcher (video)](https://youtu.be/sswA4j_IUxg)) High-level plans:

  > **Phase 1:** Prompt collection for supervised finetuning (SFT) and to get the prompts for model generated completions/answers.
  >
  > **Phase 2:** Human feedback (e.g. ranking) of multiple outputs generated by the model. Example five model outputs are shown and the user should rank them from best to worst.
  >
  > **Phase 3:** Optimization with RLHF which we plan to do via TRLX. And then the we iterate with this new model again over phase 2 and phase 3 hopefully multiple times.
  
  Models will be trained on Summit supercomputer (~6 million NVIDIA V100 hrs per year) [[source](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R7OHgW-KOXNia4z5_rBwZj_ecSf6TqzG/view)]

  **Progress:**
  
  - Feb 2023: [Joi-20B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/Rallio67/joi_20B_instruct_alpha) is a 20B model fine-tuned on [a diverse set of instruction datasets](https://github.com/Rallio67/language-model-agents) and based on NeoX-20B.
  
    _**Unofficial:** This is an early pre-release model (part of development of MVP, phase 1), not directly OpenAssistant (OA) models.
  They are experiments by the ML team to learn what data, foundation model, methods will work well for OA.
  As is stated in the website's FAQ, no demo yet.
  This is for developers to test out early development version of instruction tuning for the model. Maybe first OA models will be derived from these.
  They have been training good models on a rolling basis as new datasets get completed.
  There are a variety of model sizes from 1.4B to 20B params available on the HF Hub._
 
    [Chatty-LMS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/chatty-lms) build by HuggingFace H4 team - A UI for testing Joi-20B-instruct model. You can chat with it. The agent will reply as Joi (the [bot nickname](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/blob/main/model/model_training/tools/model_chat.py#LL15C56-L15C56)). <!-- I guess the name is loosely inspired by a friendly fictional AI in the movies? -->

    Example of code snippet to run the model on your own GPUs: https://gist.github.com/cedrickchee/236e53ed2dca95bd96e5baa35cdd7be2
    
  - Mar 2023: They're currently processing the data collected from contributions. The data has over 100k messages, meaning millions of contributions. The quality of the data is beyond what they've ever expected — most of contributions are super high quality. Now, they are exporting the v1 of the dataset. As said, they are currently training the initial batch of models.
    - 11 Mar 2023: [The Open Instruction Generalist (OIG) dataset](https://laion.ai/blog/oig-dataset/) will be releasing. OIG is a large open source instruction dataset that currently contains ~43M instructions.
        > OIG is one of many chatbot datasets that LAION, along with its volunteers, Ontocord, Together and other members of the open source community, will be releasing and is intended to create equal access to chatbot technology. Everyone is welcome to use the dataset and contribute improvements to it.
    
    The OIG dataset is related to LAION’s Open Assistant project.

    - Compared to the original PyTorch, single-machine training process can be 7.73 times faster and single-GPU inference can be 1.42 times faster.
    - GitHub Repo: https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI

    I got the impression that the point of the article was to plug their [Colossal-AI](https://colossalai.org/) framework and product, a collection of parallel components, tools, and hardwares for large models. Frankly, their numbers do look suspicious to me, unless I've missed something.
    What makes ChatGPT interesting (over GPT-3) is the RLHF process. They do claim to replicate RLHF process completely. But, the article touch lightly about their RLHF implementation. They train RLHF using a small [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) as example dataset. Their RLHF implementation details are hidden here: https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/blob/main/applications/ChatGPT. Lack of demo doesn't inspire too much confidence though.

Key features: 1) up to 100x faster than other offloading systems. **2) Compress both the parameters and attention cache of models down to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss.** 3) Distributed pipeline parallelism. They also provide a Python script and instructions that you can [run a chatbot with OPT models](https://github.com/Ying1123/FlexGen#run-chatbot-with-opt-models-on-a-single-gpu). This should solve the challenges of high computational and memory requirements of LLM inference. The chatbot they build with FlexGen and OPT models is not instruction-tuned (RLHF). So this chatbot is not ChatGPT-like though. [[Paper](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen/blob/0342e2a0e93593b2c11f84be0e9f5d5bcb73e598/docs/paper.pdf)]
    - Runtime breakdown from their paper:
        - Faster than DeepSpeed offloading (Table 2. Generation throughput on 1 GPU = 1.12 token/s (using 4-bit compression))
    - FlexGen achieves super-linear scaling on decoding throughput (which only counts decoding time costs assuming the prefill is done). This means if we generate more tokens, pipeline parallelism will show its benefits as decoding time will dominate.

Their RLHF implementation (actor critic trainer, actor-reward model) was inspired by [lucidrains's PaLM-rlhf-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch) implementation. You can also generate your own prompt dataset using LangChain's agents and prompt templates. (_They have removed their misleading ["15x faster training than ChatGPT" claim](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm/commit/6c6c24f6e6317fb5214afadd28523e198549f75e). We don't know how fast ChatGPT trained. Many people debate the performance of that repo (based on what?). Another evidence of people talking about things they don't understand about in deep learning. We should stay grounded._)
- [Fine-tuning 20B LLMs with RLHF on a 24GB consumer GPU](https://huggingface.co/blog/trl-peft) by HuggingFace - It is now possible using the integration of TRL with PEFT. The blog post explains how they achieve this step by step. The base model is gpt-neox (I was hoping the show fine-tuning LLaMA. I think they can't because of LLaMA licensing restrictions.)
- [OpenChatKit by Together Compute](https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit) - Build your own ChatGPT. A powerful, open-source base to create chatbots for various applications. [Try](https://huggingface.co/spaces/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit). Much more than a model release. They are releasing a set of tools and processes for ongoing improvement. OpenChatKit includes 4 key components:
    - An instruction-tuned LLM, fine-tuned for chat from EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX-20B with over 43M instructions on compute available under Apache-2.0 license on HuggingFace.
    - A set of customization recipes to fine-tune the model to achieve high accuracy on your tasks documented and available as open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit), along with code to recreate our model results.
    - An extensible retrieval system enabling you to augment bot responses with information from a document repository, API, or other live-updating information source at inference time, with open-source examples for using Wikipedia or a web search API.
    - A moderation model, fine-tuned from GPT-JT-6B, designed to filter which questions the bot responds to, also available on HuggingFace.
    - They collaborated with the tremendous communities at LAION and friends to create the Open Instruction Generalist (OIG) 43M dataset used for these models.
- [Alpaca: A Strong Open-Source Instruction-Following Model](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) by Stanford - Alpaca is a fine-tuned version of LLaMA that can respond to instructions like ChatGPT. Simon Willison wrote about [_Alpaca, and the acceleration of on-device large language model development_](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/13/alpaca/). The team at Stanford just released the [Alpaca training code](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#fine-tuning) for fine-tuning LLaMA with [Hugging Face's transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llama). ~Also, the [PR implementing LLaMA models](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955) support in Hugging Face was approved yesterday.~
  - [Alpaca.cpp](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp) - Locally run an instruction-tuned chat-style LLM. This combines the LLaMA foundation model (llama.cpp) with an [open reproduction (Alpaca-LoRA)](https://github.com/cedrickchee/alpaca-lora) of [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca), a fine-tuning of the base model to obey instructions (akin to the [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) used to train ChatGPT).
  - [Alpaca Native](https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/alpaca-native) model weights - The model was fine-tuned using the original repository: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca (no LoRA has been used). [HuggingFace Transformers inference (code and quick start guide)](https://gist.github.com/cedrickchee/3be95c8ab9f38132382737783bd5d55e).
  - [Train and run Stanford Alpaca on your own machine](https://replicate.com/blog/replicate-alpaca) - The Replicate team have repeated the training process and published a tutorial about how they did it. It cost less than $100.

- [OpenAI's attempts to watermark AI text hit limits](https://archive.vn/20221212144831/https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/10/openais-attempts-to-watermark-ai-text-hit-limits/) - Watermarking may allow for detection of AI text. This post discusses some of the limitations but suggests that it's worth pursuing. Prof. Scott Aaronson "expressed the belief that, if OpenAI can demonstrate that watermarking works and doesn't impact the quality of the generated text, it has the potential to become an industry standard.". OpenAI engineer Hendrik Kirchner built a working prototype.
    - Related: [Scott Aaronson talks AI Safety on Nov 2022 (video)](https://youtu.be/fc-cHk9yFpg?t=3194) - GPT outputs will be statistically watermarked with a secret signal that you can use to proof the outputs came from GPT, making it much harder to take a GPT output and pass it off as if it came from a human. How it works, it selects the tokens pseudorandomly using cryptographic PRNG that secretly biases a certain score which you can also compute if you know the key for this PRNG. Scott doesn’t give too many details about how it works and he admits this can be defeated with enough effort, for example by using one AI to paraphrase another. But if you just insert or delete a few words or rearrange the order of some sentences, the signal will still be there. So it's robust against those sorts of interventions. Many suspect its possible to bypass using a clever decoding strategy. Scott is also researching: [Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models (2022 paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974)". People are questioning whether they are missing something, or are all these attempts at recognising LLM outputs obviously destined to fail?
    I think they've clearly thought about this but still think this is useful (from transcript of the lecture: https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6823).
- [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/) - An app that can quickly and efficiently detect whether an essay is ChatGPT or human written.

## Emerging Software Development and Business Paradigm

[Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)? [Software 3.0?](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1273788774422441984) Generative AI?

(_Reflections on how best to think of the current state of software engineering, AI products, and pitfalls people tend to make with new tech._)

It's very rare to see a new building block emerge in computing. Large AI models like ChatGPT represent a fundamentally new building block. By integrating large models into software, developers can expose functionality that wouldn't be possible otherwise. <!-- rephrase: LLMs are emerging as a transformative tech, enabling developers to build apps that they previously could not. -->
This may be one of the biggest changes in software we've ever seen — a new type of software.

Using LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a powerful app — the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of knowledge or computation.

**Is Software 3.0 silly? worth the hype?**

I don't know. I think of "Software 3.0" as:
- a metaphor for the new trends in software development and large AI models
- a different paradigm; companies leverage customer data to train their proprietary AI models and optimize product experiences and customers receive added value from the product.

You say investment into generative AI companies is way too exuberant right now? <!-- someone estimated there are less than NNN people in the world right now who know how to effectively train billion+ parameter models with startup resources. --> <!-- someone predict: that will be a myth of the past and within the year, the knowledge will become accessible. -->
[What's the big deal with Generative AI? Is it the future or the present?](https://txt.cohere.ai/generative-ai-future-or-present/)

> 1- Recent AI developments are awe-inspiring and promise to change the world. But when?
>
> 2- Make a distinction between impressive 🍒 cherry-picked demos, and reliable use cases that are ready for the marketplace
>
> 3- Think of models as components of intelligent systems, not minds
>
> 4- Generative AI alone is only the tip of the iceberg

The current climate in AI is making some uncomfortable. Everyone is expecting as a sure thing "civilization-altering" impact (& 100x returns on investment) in the next 2-3 years. [^6]

### ChatGPT Alternatives

- [Anthropic's Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/earlyaccess) - Overall, Claude is a serious competitor to ChatGPT, with improvements in many areas. [[review by Riley Goodside et al.](https://scale.com/blog/chatgpt-vs-claude), [my short analysis](https://twitter.com/cedric_chee/status/1633764765700091904)]
- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) - A new search interface that uses OpenAI GPT 3.5 and Microsoft Bing to directly answer any question you ask.
- Bart from Google
- Sparrow from DeepMind
- YouChat
- Poe from Quora
- Bloom from BigScience
- Character AI
- Jasper Chat
- [Phind](https://phind.com/) - An "assistant" that simply tells users what the answer is. Optimized for developers and technical questions. Powered by proprietary LLMs (they use OpenAI API and their own models). It's strange that they market themself as search engine.

Lightly based on [publicly announced ChatGPT variants and competitors](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1606611869661384706) Tweet.

His argument is reasonable and well written.
