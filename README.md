# ChatGPT Universe

This tiny place of the Web stores a growing collection of interesting things
about [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and GPT-3 from OpenAI.

I want an all-in-one place to keep things about ChatGPT. So, I hand-curated this
list with the help of others (acknowleged below).

The collections are not limited to only the best resources, tools, examples,
demos, hacks, apps, and usages of ChatGPT.

<!-- my personal brain dumps? -->

### Prompt Engineering

> Wanted: Prompt engineer. Minimum 10 years prompt engineering experience. #hiring #joke

- [Why "Prompt Engineering" and "Generative AI" are overhyped](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/why-prompt-engineering-and-generative)

> Prompt engineering is dead, long live dialogue engineering.
> — VP Product, OpenAI

Reason:

> Why does ChatGPT work so well? Is it "just scaling up GPT-3" under the hood? In this 🧵, let's discuss the "Instruct" paradigm, its deep technical insights, and a big implication: **"prompt engineering" as we know it may likely disappear soon**.
