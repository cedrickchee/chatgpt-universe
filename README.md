# ChatGPT Universe

This tiny place of the Web stores a growing collection of interesting things
about [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and GPT-3 from OpenAI.

I want an all-in-one place to keep things about ChatGPT. So, I hand-curated this
list with the help of others (acknowleged below).

The collections are not limited to only the best resources, tools, examples,
demos, hacks, apps, and usages of ChatGPT.

<!-- my personal brain dumps? -->

### Prompt Engineering

> Wanted: Prompt engineer. Minimum 10 years prompt engineering experience. #hiring #joke

- [Why "Prompt Engineering" and "Generative AI" are overhyped](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/why-prompt-engineering-and-generative)

> Prompt engineering is dead, long live dialogue engineering.
> — VP Product, OpenAI

Reason:

> Why does ChatGPT work so well? Is it "just scaling up GPT-3" under the hood? In this 🧵, let's discuss the "Instruct" paradigm, its deep technical insights, and a big implication: **"prompt engineering" as we know it may likely disappear soon**.
> Source: https://archive.is/dqHI8

## Videos

- [This AI has a JAILBREAK?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8ljAkdFtg) - If you're into video, this one gave a good overview.

## Development

### Unofficial API and SDK.

- [rawandahmad698/PyChatGPT](https://github.com/rawandahmad698/PyChatGPT) (Python) - Lightweight, TLS-Based API on your CLI without requiring a browser or access token.
- [acheong08/ChatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) (Python) - Lightweight package for interacting with ChatGPT's API by OpenAI. Uses reverse engineered official API.
- [transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) (Node.js) - Node.js client for the unofficial ChatGPT API and using a headless browser.
- [ChatGPT-MS](https://github.com/shiyemin/ChatGPT-MS) - Multi-Session ChatGPT API. The main code is copied from PyChatGPT.

### Tools

- [safer-prompt-evaluator](https://github.com/alignedai/chatgpt-prompt-evaluator) - This shows the results from using a second, filter LLM that analyses prompts before sending them to ChatGPT.
- [Dust](https://github.com/dust-tt/dust) - Design and deploy large language model (LLM) apps. Generative models app specification and execution engine. Prompt engineering, re-imagined with one goal, help accelerate LLMs deployment.
- [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/) - Building applications with LLMs through composability.

### Training Data

- [LAION LLM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KY2_DVye-dv4y-38sVw5ZOUhD4Lc9ft9_1hF5PlZ2A/edit) - Gathering Data for, training and sharing of a LAION Large Language Models (LLLM). The group is still writing a tech proposal of FlanT5-Atlas architecture (or poor man's ChatGPT@Home).
- [open-chatgpt-prompt-collective](https://github.com/SurfaceData/open-chatgpt-prompt-collective) by Surface Data Collective - A website to generate prompts for training an Open ChatGPT model.
- [BigScience P3 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3) - P3 (Public Pool of Prompts) is a collection of prompted English datasets covering a diverse set of NLP tasks.
- [Data Augmentation To Create Instructions Form Text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13a188pPvqnlvuVa3e_suVz4YO5s-JWeiOOrpp0odImg/edit) - discussion on LAION's Discord. The key to creating a better FlanT5 (ChatGPT@Home).
- In OpenAI's papers on GPT-2 and GPT-3.x, they mentioned references to these datasets:
  - [Common Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl)
    - Number of Tokens: 410 billion
    - Weight in training mix: 60%
  - [WebText2](https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/owt2/)
    - An internet dataset created by scraping URLs extracted from Reddit submissions with a minimum score of 3 as a proxy for quality, deduplicated at the document level with MinHash
    - Number of Tokens: 19 billion
    - Weight in training mix: 20%
  - Books1[^4]
    - Number of Tokens: 12 billion
    - Weight in training mix: 8%
  - Books2[^4]
    - Number of Tokens: 55 billion
    - Weight in training mix: 8%
  - Wikipedia
    - Number of Tokens: 3 billion
    - Weight in training mix: 3%

[^4]: A key component of GPT-3.5 models are Books1 and Books2.
      [Books1](https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus/issues/27#issuecomment-716104208) - aka BookCorpus, a free books scraped from smashwords.com.
      Books2 - We know very little about what this is, people suspect it's libgen, but it's purely conjecture.
      Nonetheless, books3 is "all of bibliotik".

### Open Source ChatGPT

We want a ChatGPT alternative like Stable Diffusion.

Goals:
- Open source effort towards OpenAI's ChatGPT.
- Reverse engineer and replicate ChatGPT models and training data.

Ultimate goal: self-hosted version of ChatGPT.

- [FLAN-T5 XXL](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) aka. ChatGPT@Home is a public model that has undergone instruction finetuning. XXL is a 11B model. It is currently the most comparable model against ChatGPT (InstructGPT models are initialized from GPT-3.x series ([model card](https://github.com/openai/following-instructions-human-feedback/blob/main/model-card.md))). There are successful attempts deploying FLAN-T5 on GPU with 24 GB RAM with [bitsandbytes-Int8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxSo4lQgMDBdnd19VBEoaG-mMfQupQ3XvOrgmRAVtpU/edit) inference for Hugging Face models. You can run the model easily on a single machine, without performance degradation. This could be a game changer in enabling people outside of big tech companies being able to use these LLMs. Efforts are already underway to create a better FLAN-T5. The community (i.e., LAION) are working on FlanT5-Atlas architecture and a collection of prompted/instructions datasets.
  - [Fine-tuning GPT-J-6B in Colab: 8-bit weights with low-rank adaptors (LORA)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14839). ([Quantized EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b model with 8-bit weights](https://huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit))
    - How many GPU and how much VRAM is required to run the model? Around 175GB or ~8x 24GB consumer GPUs. Details: [A Gentle Introduction to 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for transformers at scale using Hugging Face Transformers, Accelerate and bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)
- [CarperAI/TRLX](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx)

  - It allows you to fine-tune Hugging Face language models (GPT2, GPT-NeoX based) up to 20B parameters using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
  - Brought to you by CarperAI (an EleutherAI lab). They have [announced plans for the first open-source "instruction-tuned" LM](https://carper.ai/instruct-gpt-announcement/). CarperAI started by developing production ready open-source RLHF tools.
- [allenai/RL4LMs](https://github.com/allenai/RL4LMs) - RL for language models (RL4LMs) by Allen AI. It's a modular RL library to fine-tune language models to human preferences.
